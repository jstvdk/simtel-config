# The 0.5/0.5/-0.5/-0.5 sequence corresponds to first taking the running
# average of two slices and then taking the difference with the pre-predecessor
# of that:
#    z[i] = 0.5 * (y[i]+y[i-1]) - 0.5 * (y[i-2]+y[i-3])
# Main advantage: better phase stability.

# This version here trying to more closely emulate FlashCam FPGA
# behaviour - which does this in integer.
