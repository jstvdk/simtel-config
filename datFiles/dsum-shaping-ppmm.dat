# The 1/1/-1/-1 sequence (termed "ppmm") corresponds to first taking the running
# average of two slices and then taking the difference with the pre-predecessor
# of that, for reasons of integer processing actually twice that:
#    z[i] = 2.*0.5 * (y[i]+y[i-1]) - 2.*0.5 * (y[i-2]+y[i-3])
# Main advantage: better phase stability.

# This version here trying to more closely emulate FlashCam FPGA
# behaviour - which does this in integer.
