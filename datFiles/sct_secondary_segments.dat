# RINGsegments approximation for the SCT secondary reflector,
# using the parameters from Table 4 of the TDR document (MAN-PO/120915).

# Format of lines: type nseg { rmin rmax dphi phi0 | x y diam rot }
#    type: RINGsegments | SQUAREsegments | (Y)HEXsegments | CIRCULARsegments
#          (the capital part being the minimum abbreviation required).
#          Instead of the two fundamental orientations of hexagons used
#          for pixels and mirror tiles in single-reflector configurations,
#          the orientation of hexagons is defined by the rotation angle
#          (0 degrees corresponding to shape type 1, with two flat sides
#          parallel to the x axis, 90 deg. corresponding to shape type 3).
#    nseg: Number of segments in this group; must be =1 except for ring segments
#    Ring segments:
#       rmin, rmax: minimum and maximum radius of ring in x/y projection [cm].
#       dphi: angle around axis subtended by each segment [deg.];
#             for a complete ring it would be 360/nseg.
#       phi0: angle around axis where first segment starts [deg.].
#    Other segment types (configured individually):
#       x, y: position of segment center in x/y projection [cm].
#       diam: diameter of segment in projection along surface normal at center [cm].
#       rot:  rotation angle of segment around its own axis (sq.+hex) [deg.]

# Inner ring:
# RING 8 39.45 159.65 45.0 0 0.0 # No gaps
RING 8 39.70 159.40 45.0 0 0.5 # 0.5 cm gaps everywhere

# Outer ring:
# RING 16 159.65 270.83 22.5 0 0.0 # No gaps
RING 16 159.90 270.58 22.5 0 0.5 # 0.5 cm gaps everywhere
