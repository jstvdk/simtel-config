% The effect of a 94% collection efficiency is already included in the
% above single-p.e. spectrum. Only use a value below 1.0 if the actual
% collection efficiency is lower than 94%.
pm_collection_efficiency = 1.0
% pm_photoelectron_spectrum = spe_R11920-MS_ap0.0002.dat % As in prod-2
pm_photoelectron_spectrum = spe_LST_2020-05-09_AP2.0e-4.dat % New LST data with afterpulse ratio scaled to 2e-4.

% The tubes are foreseen to be operated at low gain.
% This has no direct implications on the analog (discriminator) and digitized
% (FADC) amplitudes (which may involve pre-amplifiers) but on the
% effect of TRIGGER_CURRENT_LIMIT together with NIGHTSKY_BACKGROUND.
  pm_average_gain = 4e4
% trigger_current_limit = 20.0 % [microAmps] 

% Scaling factor for NSB w.r.t. the the HESS Photonis XP 2960 tubes is
% about 1.42 (depends also on the mirror reflectivity curve).
% Geometric scaling, including mirror area, "shadowing" by masts,
% pixel solid angle, mirror and light cone optical efficiency go separately. 
% nightsky_background = all:0.100 % HESS p.e. per nanosecond (important: "all:" !!)
% Suggested NSB value for LST (f=28 m, 382 m^2 mirror, pixels of 49 mm plus 1 mm gap):
%    nightsky_background = all:0.217 %% 217 MHz NSB p.e. rate
% Suggested NSB value for MST (f=16 m, 104.8 m^2 mirror, pixels of 49 mm plus 1 mm gap):
%    nightsky_background = all:0.171 %% 171 MHz NSB p.e. rate
% All for dark sky regions, off the Galactic plane and at small
% zenith angles. At larger zenith angles the afterglow component of the
% NSB light will be stronger. In the Galactic plane, a factor of two
% brighter is often the case, in some regions even a factor of three.

% Parameters for PMT-to-PMT fluctuations:
% pm_gain_index = 5.5   % gain is power-law of voltage
% pm_gain_index = 5.8   % +- 0.2 (Pierre Jean 2017-09-28: G = a * HV**(k * n) with k~0.8, assumes passive divider.
pm_gain_index = 4.0     % For 7-dynode PMTs with first dynode stabilized at 300 V (or 350 V). Applies to rest of the voltage.
gain_variation = 0.02 % random gain variation
pm_voltage_variation = 0.03 % random voltage variation at given gain
pm_transit_time = 20.,9.7,300.,1100. % full and first dynode transit times at nominal voltage (may differ for 7- and 8-dynode variants)
qe_variation = 0.035  % random QE variation (based on one batch of R12992 tubes, averaged over spectrum)

% The quantum efficiency based on measurements in Erlangen:
% quantum_efficiency = qe_R11920-100-02.dat    % A bit older 8-stage type as used in LST-1
% quantum_efficiency = qe_R12992-100-05.dat    % Recent 7-stage type (measurements of first 15 tubes)
quantum_efficiency = qe_R12992-100-05b.dat     % Recent 7-stage type (382 tubes measured in Erlangen)

% This value is still as used for prod-2 and may need to be revised:
% transit_time_jitter  = 0.64  % PMT single p.e. transit time jitter r.m.s. [ns]. (->1.5 ns FWHM)
% Revised value based on FlashCam measurements of TTJ r.m.s. value:
transit_time_jitter  = 0.70  % PMT single p.e. transit time jitter r.m.s. [ns].

% The single-p.e. pulse shape at the discriminator needs to be verified.
% Note that with a 0.64 ns r.m.s. transit time jitter, the multi-p.e.
% pulse shape would not be dominated by the transit time jitter.
discriminator_pulse_shape=pulse_CTA-Fx.dat % FWHM=3.16 ns at gain 5e4 (may differ for 7- and 8-dynode variants)

% The digitized single-p.e. pulse shape appropriate for GHz sampling
% (FWHM 3.1 ns) but may have to be replaced for slower sampling.
fadc_pulse_shape = pulse_CTA-Fx3.dat % FWHM=3.21 ns at gain 5e4 (will differ for camera types due to preamp bandwidth)

% No saturation like in SiPMs due to limited number of microcells:
pixel_cells = 0
